# Sentiment-Analysis
This is my project for Data Mining Course wherein I predict the sentiment from text reviews. It involves solving the problem using 2 approaches - Machine Learning SVM and Deep Learning - Keras

# DMProject2.ipynb:
This is the file which includes experimenting with SVM cost factor 0.1,1,10 and 100. Also it includes kernel type like linear, poly, rbf and sigmoid.

# DMProject.ipynb
This includes experimenting with SVM with linear, rbf and sigmoid kernels with cost factor C values from 110 to 150
